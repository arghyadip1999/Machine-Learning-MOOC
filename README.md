# Machine-Learning-MOOC

This is the official repository of the Koderunners Machine Learning MOOC. The MOOC will contain articles explaining each topic present on the upcoming Koderunners website (http://koderunners.org). We will try to publish at least one article every week. This repository will contain the quiz and/or assignments for each article/section of the MOOC.
