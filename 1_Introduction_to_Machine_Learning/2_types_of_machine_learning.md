Now, that was an obvious definition, but what does it mean??? In order to understand Machine Learning, let us consider a real-life example. Let us imagine that we have the temperature data for 7 days and we wish to predict what would the temperature would be like on the eighth day. Let us first consider the following imaginary data:
```
Days  Temperatures
1          32.4
2          34.6
3          32.7
4          32.6
5          32.8
6          32.9
7          33.1
```
![Plot of Temperature against Days](https://github.com/koderunners/Machine-Learning-MOOC/blob/master/1_Introduction_to_Machine_Learning/Assets/figure_1.png)
From the above visualization, we can see that the temperature increases almost linearly with the passing days. Thus we can approximate the temperature to be a linear function of the number of days, i.e, if we consider the temperature to be ```y``` and number of days to be ```x```, then the linear function can be represented as ```y = m * x + c```
