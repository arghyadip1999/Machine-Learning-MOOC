# Types of Machine Learning
>Machine Learning is a field of Mathematics and Computer Science, that gives Machines or Computers the ability to learn. - Wikipedia

Now, that was an obvious definition, but what does it mean??? In order to understand Machine Learning, let us consider a real-life example. Let us imagine that we have the temperature data for 7 days and we wish to predict what would the temperature would be like on the eighth day. Let us first consider the following imaginary data:
```
Days  Temperatures
1          32.4
2          34.6
3          32.7
4          32.6
5          32.8
6          32.9
7          33.1
```
