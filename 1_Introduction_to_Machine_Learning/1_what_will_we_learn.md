# Chapter 1: What will We Learn???
When I was in my first year at college, I was very curious. I had had some prior programming experience and could not wait to apply my skills in some project. Unfortunately, there was just a single Computer Science subject in the whole semester which was programming in C and the rest of the subjects felt like wastage of my time. So, I used to contact some of my seniors and discuss with them advanced topics of Computer Science besides doing competitive programming. It was in one such discussions, I came across the term Machine Learning. As soon as I heard the words, a thousand questions came into my mind; what is it? what to do with it? what are machines? what do machines learn? how the hell do they learn? Is it related to AI .....

Two long years have since passed, I completed 4 semesters with about 25 subjects, still those questions haunt me. The difference between my 2 years younger self and the current me is that I have read several books on the topic, watched uncountable videos and worked on some real life problems which has given me some experience regarding how Machine Learning is done based on which I can atleast attempt to answer the questions, the perfect answers to which I don't really know.
